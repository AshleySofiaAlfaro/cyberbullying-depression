# Cyberbullying and Depression: A Case Study Using Data From Selangor, Malaysia

## Overview
This repository contains my research project completed as part of the **Supporting Pacific Indigenous Computing Excellence (SPICE) Program 2024**. The SPICE program provides opportunities for students from underrepresented communities to gain hands-on experience in computing research and present their work to academic and industry stakeholders.

My project explored the **impact of cyberbullying on depression among college students in Selangor, Malaysia**. Using a dataset of 561 students, the study aimed to identify relationships between different categories of cyberbullying and self-reported levels of depression.
